## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

1. Initialize Git repo
2. Sketch layout and sections referencing figma file
3. Build out html file with design elements
4. Create stylesheet with boilerplate resets and font sizes in rems
5. Add custom properties (font family, colors)
6. Apply styling to all element content
7. Apply sizing and layout rules to build out mobile design
8. Add responsiveness for larger screen sizes per design
9. Final tweaks, editing, proofreading

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to leave my root font-size at 16px if I want my custom property font sizes to match their equivalent px sizes.

I learned how to leave out declaring some sizes in order to allow for better responsiveness.

I learned how great gap is at adding some quick spacing between elements instead of lots of specific top and bottom padding. Even though the elements spacing isn't exactly pixel perfect with the design, I felt in this case, the efficiency of using gap for the spacing more than made up for slight deviation from the design.

I also learned how to have my media queries show and hide different sized images for mobile and desktop.

### Continued development

I would still like to find information on balancing pixel perfect comformity to the design vs effiency of code and time. What is considered "close enough"?

### Useful resources

MDN and w3schools references.

Thank you Katrine for helping me figure out media query breakpoints that looked pretty good.
